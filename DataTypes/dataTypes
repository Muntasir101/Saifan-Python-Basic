str(String): Sequence of characters
Creating String:
1. Single Quotes
2. Double Quotes
3. Triple Quotes

Numeric Type: represents a number
1. Integer(int): Whole number without a decimal point. They can be positive, negative or zero
2. Floating-Point Numbers(float): Number with a decimal point. They can be positive, negative or zero
3. Complex Numbers(complex): Number have a real part and an imaginary part. Format a + bj where a is a real part and b is the imaginary part

Sequence Type:
List: Store an ordered collection of items which can be different types.
List is mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after they are created.
Each element is separated by coma.

Tuple: Store an ordered collection of items which can be different types.
Tuple is immutable, meaning their contents can not be changed,added or removed after they are created.
Each element is separated by coma.

Range: Immutable sequence of numbers,typically used for looping.Range object provides
way to generate a sequence of numbers without creating a list in memory.

Dictionary: Stores collection of key-value pairs. Dictionary is mutable.Each element is separated by coma.
Element can be any data type.

Set: Unordered collection of unique elements. Sets is mutable.Each element is separated by comma.
Set do not allow duplicate elements.

Frozenset: Is immutable version of set.

Boolean: Represents True or False

NoneType: Is the type of None object, which is used to represents the absence of a value or
a null value.
